## Inspiration
I have always wanted to go into medicine because I wanted to make a difference in people's lives every single day. However, recently I realized that as a clinician, although I would be helping people, it would only be a handful at a time. Whereas if I were to develop an application of technology that revolutionized health care, I would be impacting the lives of hundreds of thousands if not millions of individuals worldwide! The importation for SunWatch came from one of my classes this year where we were tasked to create a medical intervention that prevented or treated skin cancer. 

## What it does
Exposure to UV or ultraviolet radiation is one of the leading causes of skin cancer. By being more aware of what measures we can take to protect ourselves, we limit our risk of developing skin cancer in the future. SunWatch works by having the user input their location and the UV index of the day, based on that information, SunWatch provides the user with helpful tips and suggestions as what to wear and how much sunscreen to apply throughout the day. Although it may seem simple in theory, if applied correctly it can make a significant difference in a person's exposure to radiation. 

## How I built it
I built this application on the website for my organization, The Orchid Organization. The Orchid Organization is a community-based organization led by students whose purpose is to raise awareness about personal health and wellness. I used CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap to build the website and design it. I then used JavaScript and utilized my own web API to create a function that determined what suggestions should be given to the user based on the user's UV index input. 

## Challenges I ran into
Since I am new to coding altogether, I particularly struggled with JavaScript and creating the functionality of the SunWatch. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am extremely proud of the amount of time I completed this project in. A week or two ago, I would have taken twice as long with less that optimal results...

## What I learned
I learned a lot about using functions in JavaScript and how to use variables, events, and how even the smallest typo can throw the entire code off. 

## What's next for The Orchid Organization: SunWatch
I hope to incorporate AI into my SunWatch so that the suggestions are more personalized to the user's location, such as it takes into account whether it is cloudy or sunny or rainy. I also want to find a way to personalize it so that the SunWatch accounts for whether the user is at risk for developing skin cancer due to family history or other reasons.
